                <h3>ABOUT LIC</h3>
                <hr>
                <div class="box4">
                    <p>Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is an Indian statutory insurance and investment
                        corporation headquartered in the city of Mumbai and it is the most trusted insurance company of
                        India. It is under the ownership of Government of India.

                        The Life insurance Corporation of India was established on 1 September 1956, when the Parliament
                        of India passed the Life Insurance of India Act that nationalized the insurance industry in
                        India. Over 245 insurance companies and provident societies were merged to create the
                        state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India.[3][4]

                        LIC reported 290 million policy holders as of 2019, a total life fund of ₹28.3 trillion and a
                        total value of sold policies in the year 2018–19 of ₹21.4 million. The company also reported to
                        have settled 26 million claims in 2018–19. It ranked 98th on the 2022 Fortune Global 500 list
                        with the revenue of ₹775,283 crore (US$97 billion) and the profit of ₹4,415 crore (US$550
                        million).[5]</p>
